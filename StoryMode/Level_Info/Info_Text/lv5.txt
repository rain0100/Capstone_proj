NAND gates work similarly to AND gates and NOR gates work similarly to OR gates, however they produce the opposite output.

For example, if both inputs are 1, an AND gate will output a 1 however a NAND gate will output a 0. If either input is a 1, an OR gate will output a 1 however a NOR gate will output a 0.

An easy way to think about this is to recognize that a NAND gate is the same as connecting an AND gate's output to the input of a NOT gate. Similarly, a NOR gate is the same as connecting an OR gate's output to the input of a NOT gate.
