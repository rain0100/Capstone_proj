MUXes are useful circuits that act as selectors that can choose a specific input and output its value. 

They take in 3 inputs, 2 of the inputs are regular data inputs and the third input acts as a selector. If the selector has a value of 0, the output of the MUX is equal to the first input. If the selector has a value of 1, the output of the MUX is equal to the second input.
